 <p>Khadijah bint Khuwaylid (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic">Arabic:</a>
    خَدِيجَة بِنْت خُوَيْلِد,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic">romanized:</a> Khadīja <br> bint Khuwaylid,
    c. 554<sup>[2]</sup> – November 619) was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wives_of_Muhammad">first wife</a> 
    and the<br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ummah">follower</a>
     of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophets_and_messengers_in_Islam">islamic prophet</a> 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad">muhammad.</a> 
    Khadija was the <br> daughter of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khuwaylid_ibn_Asad">Khuwaylid ibn Asad,</a> 
    a noble of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quraysh">Quraysh</a> tribe in <br>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca">Makkah</a> and a successful merchant.</p>

 <p>Khadija is often referred to by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims">Muslims</a> 
    as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wives_of_Muhammad">"The Mother of Believers".</a>  
    In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam">islam</a> 
    she is an <br>important female figure as one of the four 'ladies of heaven', 
    alongside her daughter<br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatima">Fatimah bint Muhammad,</a>  
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiya">Asiya</a> 
    the wife of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh_in_Islam">the Pharaoh,</a>  
    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_in_Islam">Mary, mother of Jesus.</a>  
     <br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad">Muhammad</a> was married to her for 25 years.</p>   

 <p>Khadija's mother, Fatima bint Za'idah, who died in 575,<sup>[3]</sup> was a 
    member of the Amir ibn <br> 
    Luayy clan of the Quraysh <sup>[4]</sup> and a third cousin of 
    Muhammad's mother, Amina.<sup>[5][6]</sup></p>

 <p>Khadija's father, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khuwaylid_ibn_Asad">Khuwaylid ibn Asad,</a> was a merchant<sup>[7]</sup> and leader. 
    According to some <br> accounts, he died c. 585 in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fijar_Wars">Sacrilegious War,</a>  but 
    according to others, he was still <br> alive when Khadija married Muhammad in 595.<sup>[8][9]</sup> 
    Khuwaylid also had a sister named <br> Ume Habib binte Asad.<sup>[10]</sup></p>

<h2>Profession</h2> [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khadija_bint_Khuwaylid&action=edit&section=1">edit</a>]

<p>Khadija was a very successful merchant. It is said that when the 
    Quraysh's trade <br>caravan <b>travellers</b> gathered to embark upon 
    their summer journey to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria_(region)">Syria</a> or winter <br>journey to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen">Yemen,</a>   
    Khadija's caravan equaled the caravans of all other traders 
    of the <br>Quraysh put together.<sup>[11]</sup> Khadija was 
    given many honorifics, including 'The Pious One', <br> 
    'Princess of Quraysh' (Ameerat-Quraysh), and 'Khadija 
    the Great' (Khadija al-Kubra).<sup>[12]</sup><br> It is said 
    that she fed and clothed the poor, assisted her relatives financially, 
    and <br> provided marriage portions for poor relations.<sup>[12]</sup> 
    Khadija was said to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanif">neither <br> believed in nor worshipped</a> idols, 
    which was atypical for pre-Islamic Arabian culture.<sup>[13]</sup>

<p>Khadija did not travel with her trade caravans; instead, 
    she employed others to trade on <br> her behalf for a commission. 
    Khadija needed a co-worker for a transaction in Syria. <br> 
    She hired young <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad">Muhammad,</a> who was in his early twenties 
    at that time, for the trade in <br> Syria, sending word that 
    she would pay to double her usual commission.<sup>[14]</sup> With 
    the <br> permission of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Talib_ibn_Abd_al-Muttalib">Abu Talib ibn Muttalib,</a> his uncle, 
    Muhammad was sent to Syria with one of <br> Khadija's servants. 
    This caravan experience earned Muhammad the honorifics of 
    al <br>-Sadiq <i>('the Truthful')</i> and al-Amin <i>('the Trustworthy').</i></p>

<p>She sent one of her servants, Maysarah, to assist him. 
    Upon returning, Maysarah gave <br> accounts of the honourable 
    way in which Muhammad had conducted his business, <br> bringing 
    back twice as much profit as Khadija had expected.<sup>[15]</sup></p>

<h2>Differing views on previous marriages</h2> [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khadija_bint_Khuwaylid&action=edit&section=2">edit</a>]
<h3>Sunni version</h3> [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khadija_bint_Khuwaylid&action=edit&section=2">edit</a>]
       
 <p>Most Sunnis accept that Khadija married three times and had 
    children from all her marriages. <br> While the order of her 
    marriages is debated, it is generally believed that she 
    first married Atiq ibn 'A'idh ibn' <br> Abdullah Al-Makhzumi, 
    followed by Malik ibn Nabash ibn Zargari ibn at-Tamimi.<sup>[16]</sup> 
    To <br> Atiq, Khadija bore a daughter named Hindah. This marriage 
    left Khadija a widow.<sup>[17]</sup> With Malik, <br> she had two sons, who 
    were named Hala and Hind.<sup>[18]</sup> Malik also left Khadija a widow, 
    dying <br> before his business became a success.<sup>[19]</sup> Khadija 
    subsequently proposed to Muhammad. 
    Her <br>respect for him had taken a place in her heart.<sup>[15]</sup></p>

<h3>Shia version</h3> [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khadija_bint_Khuwaylid&action=edit&section=2">edit</a>]

 <p>Ibn Shahrashub quoted from al-Sayyid al-Murtada in al-Shafi 
    and al-Shaykh al-Tusi in al-Talkhis, <br>that Khadija was a 
    virgin when she married Muhammad.<sup>[20]</sup> Considering the cultural 
    and intellectual situation in Hijaz, and <br>the high position and 
    status Khadija al-Kubra enjoyed, among <br>other people, it is 
    improbable that she would have married men from Banu Tamim or 
    Banu Makhzum (the two 'low' tribes; see the <br>Sunni version below).<sup>[21]</sup> 
    Some believe the two children attributed to Khadija were the children 
    of Hala, Khadija's sister. After the <br>death of Hala's husband, Khadija 
    took care of Hala and (after Hala's own death) Hala's children.<sup>[22]</sup></p>
